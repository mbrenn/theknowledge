= Data Views (DataViews)

Through data views, the modeler and user gain access to collections of objects or instances of objects.

The data views are defined in the namespace _DatenMeister.Models.Namespace_.

A data view references a view node (ViewNode) that returns one or more objects. These nodes can be chained together to enable complex data aggregations.

If a data node represents only one specific object, it is the only one present in the data collection.
