= Design for UrlReferenceField

The user can select a workspace, an extent or an item according by using the default reference dialog. 

When the user selects the workspace, the link to the Management is being created

When the user selects an extent, the link to the Extent is being created

When the user selects an object, the link to the Element is being created

If user selects an object, he can also add a property name which contains the elements to be listed. Here, the additional url parameter 'prop' will be added.
