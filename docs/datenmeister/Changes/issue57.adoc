= Issue 57

The user shall be able to create a data, a type and a forms extent within a single dialogue.

== Requirements

* The new domain has a name. For example: 'IssueMeister'
* The name of the action is called 'DomainCreateFoundation'.
** It creates one Management extent, one Type Extent and one example Data Extent
* The Management extent contains one additional ExtentType which will be automatically included
* The user can select the following information
** Name of the Domain
** Storage Location where the .xmi files are to be created
** Flag, whether a Data Extent shall also be created
* The .xmi files have the following namings:
** {Domain}_Data.xmi --> dm:///{prefix}data.{Postfix}
** {Domain}_Types.xmi --> dm:///{prefix}types.{Postfix}
** {Domain}_Management.xmi --> dm:///{prefix}management.{Postfix}
* In case a prefix is set but does not end with a '.', it will be automatically added


== Realization

* An action will be created as being called 'DomainCreateFoundation'. This action will be stored in a subpackage of 'Domain'
* The implementation will be performed in its own Assembly, including SourceCodeGeneration and Model. It will be automatically loaded into the internal Types and Management.
