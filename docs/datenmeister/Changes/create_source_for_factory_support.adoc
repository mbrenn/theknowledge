= Create Typed Wrapper Elements out of Factory

== Current Situation

At the moment, we are not able to create directly typed instances out the generated Source as in DatenMeister.Wrapper.

== Solution

During Source Code Generation, we add one static method into each class according the following principle:

 public class XXX_Wrapper
 {
    public static XXX_Wrapper Create(IFactory factory)
    {
        return new XXX_Wrapper(factory.create(_metaclass reference_));
    }
 }

The metaclass reference is available within the Shadow objects.

=== Steps

* [ ] Create Feature Branch 'feature/source_generator_for_factories'
* [ ] Update Source Generator
* [ ] Check on example
* [ ] Create Unittest
* [ ] Merge
