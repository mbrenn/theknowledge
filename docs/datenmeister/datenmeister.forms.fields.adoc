= Field Element

The DatenMeister forms support different types of field forms.
This chapter contains a description of these.


== FieldData

This base class provides the generic properties that should be supported by every field.

|===
|Name|Meaning
|name|Name of the field and the underlying property of the object
|title|Title displayed in the form
|isEnumeration|Flag indicating whether the content behind the property is an enumeration or a single element. This property is used by some field types for automatic design.
|defaultValue|If the value is not set, the value of the default property can be defined here.
|isReadOnly|Flag indicating whether the field is not writable.
