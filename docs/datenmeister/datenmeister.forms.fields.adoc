|Name|Meaning
|name|Name of the field and the underlying property of the object
|title|Title displayed in the form
|isEnumeration|Flag indicating whether the content behind the property is an enumeration or a single element. This property is used by some field types for automatic design.
|defaultValue|If the value is not set, the value of the default property can be defined here.
|isReadOnly|Flag indicating whether the field is not writable.
|isAttached|Flag indicating whether the field is attached to the object itself rather than being a property of the object.
