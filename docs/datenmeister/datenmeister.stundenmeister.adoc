=== Define or Update Periodic Events

The user can define a package and adds the periodic events into the database. 

The extent in which the StundenPlan can be created contain the ExtentType 'StundenPlan'.

== Request StundenPlan

The user can select a package and request the creation of a full StundenPlan for all items and its descendents within the package. 

The report can be created by selecting a certain viewmode and by viewing the properties of a package or of an extent. 

The report contains a week-overview with the hours as columns and the weekdays as rows. 

== Technical implementation

Create a new Assembly called 'DatenMeister.StundenPlan'. The assembly shall contain a DatenMeisterPlugin which creates a type and a form definition. This form definition is automatically loaded.

The plugin has to register a new ExtentType called 'StundenPlan'.

The plugin has to register a special viewmode which is neither a TableForm nor a RowForm. 

* The DatenMeister.WebServer itself has to be capable to handle a plugin-concept for Form Types (besides RowForm and TableForm). 
* The DatenMeister.WebServer itself has to be capable to handle additional JavaScript Files
