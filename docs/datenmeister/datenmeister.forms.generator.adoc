= Form Generators

The following form generators exist:

. For a single element: GetExtentFormForItem
. For a single element as DetailForm: GetDetailFormForItem
. For a non-existent object of a specific metaclass: GetExtentFormForItemsMetaClass
. For a list of items: GetListFormForCollection
. For a list of root elements: GetExtentFormForExtent
. For a list of elements of a property: GetListFormForPropertyValues


== Types of Form Generators

There are:

. FormFinder: Finds the best form from existing definitions via FormAssociation.
. FormCreator: Creates the best form from available data.
. FormFactory: First calls the FormFinder, then the FormCreator if the corresponding form was not found.

Additionally, there are FormModifications, which subsequently change a form that has already been generated.
